# **Stage 1: Initial Brainstorming Using a Problem-First Approach**

## Part 1: Identify Pain Points

!!! note "Prompt"

    I want you to now take the role of an expert in analysing existing businesses and helping new entrepreneurs to launch new products.

    As we have discussed before, the product that I am going to launch is a service that guides software engineers on the creation of video courses, blog posts and similar material that they can sell and make money from. The service will take the form of cohorts, one to one coaching, video courses, ebooks, community support and mentorship.

    I want to take a problem-first approach to brainstorming about this target market. Given this information, what do you think are some common pain points software engineers face in creating content (such as courses or books) that they can sell?

    Please think of at least 10 different ideas, and break your answers down in a bullet point summary.

Here are some common pain points that software engineers might face when creating contentsuch as courses or books to sell:

- **Content Structuring**: Engineers may struggle with organizing their technical knowledge into a structured format that is easy for learners to follow.
- **Marketing Skills**: Many software engineers may lack experience in marketing and promoting their content effectively to reach a wider audience.
- **Audience Understanding**: Identifying and understanding the target audience's needs and preferences can be challenging, leading to misaligned content.
- **Time Management**: Balancing content creation with other professional and personal responsibilities can be difficult, leading to delays or burnout.
- **Technical Jargon**: Engineers often use complex terminology that may not be easily understood by beginners, making it hard to communicate concepts clearly.
- **Pricing Strategy**: Determining the right pricing strategy for their content can be confusing, especially when considering market competition and perceived value.
- **Platform Selection**: Choosing the right platform for hosting and selling their content can be overwhelming due to the variety of options available.
- **Engagement Techniques**: Keeping learners engaged and motivated throughout the course or book is a common challenge, especially in self-paced formats.
- **Feedback Incorporation**: Effectively gathering and incorporating feedback from early users or beta testers to improve content quality can be a daunting task.
- **Monetization Models**: Understanding different monetization models (e.g., one-time purchase vs. subscription) and selecting the most suitable one for their content can be complex.

Addressing these pain points through your service offerings can help software engineers successfully create and sell their educational content.

    That response is a fantastic start. Can you now please expand on all of the ideas you provided with specific examples of how each can be implemented?

Certainly! Hereâ€™s an expanded look at each pain point with specific examples of how they can be addressed:

- **Content Structuring**:
Offer templates and frameworks that guide engineers in organizing their content logically. For example, provide a course outline template that breaks down topics into modules and lessons, ensuring a smooth learning progression.

- **Marketing Skills**:
Conduct workshops or webinars on digital marketing strategies specifically for tech content. Include topics like SEO for technical blogs, social media marketing, and email campaigns to help engineers reach their target audience effectively.

- **Audience Understanding**:
Develop tools or exercises that help engineers create detailed audience personas. This could involve surveys, interviews, or feedback sessions with potential learners to better understand their needs and pain points.

- **Time Management**:
Create a time management toolkit tailored for content creators, including planners, productivity apps, and prioritization techniques. Offer coaching sessions on balancing content creation with other commitments.

- **Technical Jargon**:
Provide training on simplifying complex concepts and using analogies to make technical content more accessible. Include examples of effective communication from successful courses or books.

- **Pricing Strategy**:
Offer a pricing strategy workshop that covers market analysis, competitor pricing, and value-based pricing models. Include case studies of successful pricing strategies in the tech education market.

- **Platform Selection**:
Create a comparison guide of various platforms (e.g., Teachable, Udemy, Gumroad) highlighting their features, costs, and best use cases. Offer consultations to help engineers choose the platform that aligns with their goals.

- **Engagement Techniques**:
Develop a resource library with engagement techniques such as interactive quizzes, gamification elements, and community forums. Provide examples of how these techniques have been successfully implemented in other courses.

- **Feedback Incorporation**:
Set up a feedback loop process where engineers can gather input from beta testers or early users. Offer tools for analyzing feedback and actionable steps for integrating it into content revisions.

- **Monetization Models**:
Educate engineers on different monetization options through workshops or e-books. Discuss the pros and cons of models like one-time purchases, subscriptions, or freemium models with upsells.

By addressing these specific areas with targeted solutions, your service can effectively support software engineers in overcoming common challenges in content creation and monetization.
