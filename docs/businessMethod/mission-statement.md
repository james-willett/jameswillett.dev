## Business USPs

!!! info

    The following questions are designed to help you brainstorm your USPs. You should refer back to your research from Module 1, Class 5 ‘Positioning Your Business in the Market’ to help you identify how your product meets the needs of your potential customers.

### **What are my customers favourite things about my product?**

They love the visually appealing and polished presentation of the materials, which makes learning more engaging and enjoyable. The concise, no-fluff approach ensures that they can focus on what truly matters, while still receiving in-depth explanations where needed. My consistent dedication and approachable demeanour create a comfortable learning environment.

### **What things make my customers come back and continue buying from me?**

Customers return because they trust that my content consistently delivers clear, actionable insights without wasting their time. They know they will always receive high-quality, well-structured materials that help them solve real problems efficiently. The calm, patient approach I bring to teaching makes the learning process enjoyable and stress-free.

### **What could potentially make my customers stop buying from me?**

If the content becomes outdated or no longer aligns with the latest industry trends and technologies, customers may seek more current resources elsewhere. They expect up-to-date, relevant materials that address their evolving needs.

Customers might stop buying if they feel that the content is no longer as concise and efficient as they expect, or if it starts including unnecessary filler. They value the no-fluff approach and could turn to alternatives if they perceive a drop in quality or focus.

### **What might they buy instead of my product?**

Some may choose to enroll in comprehensive coding bootcamps like General Assembly or CareerFoundry, which offer immersive, career-focused training with additional benefits like mentorship and job placement support.
