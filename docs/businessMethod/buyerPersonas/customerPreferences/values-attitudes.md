# Values and Attitudes of Potential Customers

!!! note "Prompt"

    How do values and attitudes of potential customers influence their purchasing behaviour for my new service that guides software engineers on creating content? 

The values and attitudes of potential customers—software engineers considering a service that helps them create content—strongly influence their purchasing behavior. These individuals are driven by a combination of professional growth, personal development, and a desire to contribute to the tech community. Understanding these underlying motivations is key to shaping your service offering and marketing strategy. Here are the main factors related to their values and attitudes that influence their decision-making process:

## 1. Desire for Continuous Learning and Self-Improvement
Software engineers are lifelong learners who constantly seek opportunities to upskill and stay current with industry trends. They value services that help them grow professionally, whether through improving technical skills or developing soft skills like communication and presentation.

- Influence on Purchasing Behavior: Engineers are more likely to invest in a service that offers continuous learning opportunities, such as regular updates, tutorials, or coaching sessions. They want to ensure that the service will help them improve over time, not just provide a one-time solution[2][5].

## 2. Emphasis on Personal Branding and Career Advancement
Many software engineers recognize the importance of building a personal brand in today’s competitive job market. Creating content—whether through blogs, ebooks, or video tutorials—can enhance their visibility, open doors to new job opportunities, speaking engagements, or even consulting roles.

- Influence on Purchasing Behavior: Engineers who value personal branding are more likely to purchase services that help them showcase their expertise and differentiate themselves in the tech community[2]. They will look for services that offer guidance on how to create high-quality content that resonates with their target audience.

## 3. Skepticism Toward Marketing Hype
Software engineers tend to be skeptical of traditional marketing tactics and buzzwords. They prefer straightforward, no-nonsense communication that focuses on the practical benefits of a service rather than vague promises or exaggerated claims.

- Influence on Purchasing Behavior: Engineers are more likely to trust and purchase from brands that communicate clearly and transparently about what the service offers. Providing concrete examples, case studies, or free trials can help overcome this skepticism[4]. They want proof that your service works before committing.

## 4. Value of Efficiency and Time Management
Engineers often have demanding schedules and value efficiency in both their work and personal projects. They are likely juggling full-time jobs, side projects, and personal commitments, leaving limited time for content creation.

- Influence on Purchasing Behavior: A service that helps them save time by providing streamlined workflows, templates, or tools for content creation will appeal to this audience[2]. If your service can make content creation easier without sacrificing quality, it will be seen as highly valuable.

## 5. Preference for Practicality Over Theory
Software engineers appreciate practical solutions over theoretical advice. They want actionable steps they can implement immediately rather than abstract concepts.

- Influence on Purchasing Behavior: Engineers are more likely to purchase a service if it offers practical guidance on how to create content efficiently—such as step-by-step tutorials, templates for structuring content, or hands-on coaching[4]. Offering clear deliverables and tangible outcomes will resonate with this audience.

## 6. Alignment with Community Values
Many software engineers place a high value on contributing to the broader tech community through knowledge sharing and collaboration. They may see content creation as a way to give back by teaching others what they’ve learned.

- Influence on Purchasing Behavior: Engineers who value community engagement are more likely to support services that foster collaboration or provide opportunities for peer interaction (e.g., forums or group coaching sessions)[2]. Highlighting how your service helps them contribute meaningfully to the tech community can strengthen its appeal.

## 7. Focus on Quality and Attention to Detail
Software engineers take pride in the quality of their work—whether it’s code or content. They value services that emphasize high standards of quality in both technical accuracy and presentation.

- Influence on Purchasing Behavior: Engineers will be drawn to services that demonstrate a commitment to quality—whether through well-designed tools, expert coaching, or detailed feedback[3]. They want assurance that the content they create will be polished and professional.

## 8. Need for Autonomy and Control
Engineers often prefer having control over their projects and processes. While they appreciate guidance, they also want flexibility in how they approach content creation.

- Influence on Purchasing Behavior: A service that offers customizable solutions—such as flexible templates or optional coaching—will appeal more than rigid frameworks[5]. Allowing engineers to tailor the service to their specific needs gives them a sense of ownership over the process.

## Conclusion
The decision-making process for software engineers considering a service that helps them create content is heavily influenced by their values around continuous learning, personal branding, efficiency, practicality, community engagement, quality, skepticism toward marketing hype, and autonomy. To attract these customers:
- Emphasize clear value propositions.
- Offer practical tools and actionable guidance.
- Provide opportunities for ongoing learning.
- Foster transparency and trust through honest communication.
By aligning your service with these values and addressing their specific needs, you can effectively influence their purchasing behavior.
