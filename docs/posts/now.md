I’m in a town called Reading, just outside London in the UK. 

I'm working full-time as a Principal Software Engineer at SAP. I'm also trying to lead a balanced yet exciting and stable habit-based life with my wife Sarah and our two children Seb & Chloe.

I am open to considering new opportunities, as I highly value novelty, spontaneity, and growth. However, I aspire to stick to my priorities 90% of the time. As a result, I will say no to the majority of requests that come my way now.

If my activities or priorities happen to change, I’ll update this page to reflect those changes. Last update was **Sunday April 9th, 2023**.

This page is a public declaration and a reminder to myself, and it balances out the goal-driven nature of my Impossible List.

It was inspired by [Thomas Frank](https://thomasjfrank.com/) and [Derek Shivers](https://nownownow.com/about)
