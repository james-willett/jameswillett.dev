# Getting Started with Material for MkDocs - 2024 Edition

## Video Status

!!! info

    This is the script for the 2024 edition of the "Getting Started with Material for MkDocs" YouTube video.<br/><br/>
    **Current Status**: Reviewing Script<br/>
    **Last Updated**: 03-Sept-2024

## 1. Intro

!!! example "Section Metadata"

    **:material-video-box: Recording Type**: Narration

    **:material-text-box: Description**: Introduction to the video, outling the features we will add to our MkDocs Material website

    **:octicons-git-branch-16: Demo Branch**: `N/A`

- Welcome back to the channel! In todayâ€™s video weâ€™re diving into Material for MkDocs, the ultimate framework for creating stunning, interactive documentation sites.
- In this tutorial, weâ€™ll be creating a new documentation portal completely from scratch, and then hosting that on the web for free using GitHub pages.

??? tip "B-roll ideas"

    Animated screencasts or screenshots of the completed site showing all the features below

- Along the way, Iâ€™ll show you just a handful of the awesome features that Material for MkDocs comes bundled with, such as:

    - Setting a dynamic colour scheme
    - Adding a splash of personality with emojis, icons and logos to make your content visually appealing
    - How to create custom code blocks that adjust based on the programming language specified
    - How to better organise your content using Tabs
    - How to empathize parts of your content using admonitions - also known as callouts
    - And how to bring your ideas to life with statically rendered diagrams directly in your docs

- If that sounds like something you'd be interested in, then breathe in, breathe out, and letâ€™s explore this together ðŸ™‚

## 2. Prereqs

!!! example "Section Metadata"

    **:material-video-box: Recording Type**: Narration

    **:material-text-box: Description**: Cover off the prerequisites that the user needs to have installed to follow along with the tutorial

    **:octicons-git-branch-16: Demo Branch**: `N/A`

- Before we start, letâ€™s go over the prerequistes youâ€™ll need to have installed if you want to follow along with this tutorial

??? tip "B-roll ideas"
    Mac and Windows logos flash on screen

- Firstly, do be aware that iâ€™ll be conducting this tutorial on a Mac. If youâ€™re following on Windows then some of the commands we type into the terminal will be ever so slightly differentâ€¦ but Iâ€™ll try to call those out.

??? tip "B-roll ideas"
    B-ROLL: list of these prereqs appear to left or right of me

- So weâ€™re going to be using the __PYTHON__ version of MkDocs in this tutorial, and youâ€™ll need to have PYTHON 3 installed. Iâ€™ll be using version `3.12.4` in this video, so either that or a later version should work fine.
- Weâ€™ll be using the Python package manager called PIP to install the required dependenciesâ€¦ but if you are running Python 3.4 or later then PIP is included anyway by defaultâ€¦ otherwise if youâ€™re using an earlier version, you might need to install PIP.
- Now, to follow along with the coding, itâ€™s helpful if you have an IDE installed, and Iâ€™ll be using Visual Studio Code in this video.
- And finally, weâ€™ll be publishing our documentation portal on GITHUB PAGESâ€¦ so youâ€™ll need to have an account on [GitHub](http://github.com) and ideally have git installed and setup to work from the command line as well.

And thatâ€™s all we should need. So letâ€™s jump over to a terminal and get started!

## 3. Initial Installation

!!! example "Section Metadata"

    **:material-video-box: Recording Type**: Screencast

    **:material-text-box: Description**: In this section we go over creating the Python virtual environment and creating a vanilla MkDocs site

    **:octicons-git-branch-16: Demo Branch**: `1_InitialInstallation`

- Open a terminal in the folder that you want to create the project in
- Do `which python` to show my Python is aliased to `python3`
- Do `which python3` to show my Python is installed with Homebrew
    - Mention if you are running on Windows you can do **`where python` instead**
- Virtual environment setup with `python -m venv venv`
- `source venv/bin/activate` to activate virtual environment
- Check pip version `pip --version`
- Install mkdocs material - `pip install mkdocs-material`
- Open Visual studio code in this folder with `vscode .`
- Open a terminal within VS code and create the new site `mkdocs new .`
- Add basic `mkdocs.yml` configuration:

```yaml title="mkdocs.yml"
site_name: My MkDocs Material Documentation
site_url: https://sitename.example
theme:
  name: material
```

- Do `mkdocs serve` to launch the site
- Check the site at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## 4. Add Yaml Schema Validation

!!! example "Section Metadata"

    **:material-video-box: Recording Type**: Screencast

    **:material-text-box: Description**: Add MkDocs Material Yaml Schema Validation

    **:octicons-git-branch-16: Demo Branch**: `N/A`

- Explain that to activate most of the useful features in MkDocs Material, we need to make a few changes to the `mkdocs.yml` fileâ€¦ making these changes is much easier with the help of YAML schema validation.
- Install the `Yaml` plugin within Extensions
    - Plugin can also be found here [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)
- In VsCode open `settings.json`. You can open this by clicking on settings in the bottom left gear icon, then clicking the document icon in the top right.
- Add the following at the bottom:

```json title="settings.json"
  "yaml.schemas": {
    "https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/schema.json": "mkdocs.yml"
  },
  "yaml.customTags": [
    "!ENV scalar",
    "!ENV sequence",
    "!relative scalar",
    "tag:yaml.org,2002:python/name:material.extensions.emoji.to_svg",
    "tag:yaml.org,2002:python/name:material.extensions.emoji.twemoji",
    "tag:yaml.org,2002:python/name:pymdownx.superfences.fence_code_format"
  ]
```

- Show the `mkdocs.yml` file and how we now get popups when we mouse over elements
