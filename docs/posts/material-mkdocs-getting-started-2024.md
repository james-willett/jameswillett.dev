## 2. 'MkDocs' vs 'Material for MkDocs'

!!! example "Section Metadata"

    **:material-video-box: Recording Type**: Narration

    **:material-text-box: Description**: Highlight the differences between the Material theme for MkDocs, and the MkDocs tool itself

    **:octicons-git-branch-16: Demo Branch**: `N/A`

- Before we dive into the demo, let's go over the differences between [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), as there is often some confusion.

??? tip "B-roll ideas"
    - MkDocs logo pops up on my left, Material on my right


- Plain **MkDocs** is a static site generator specifically designed for creating documentation websites. It works by converting Markdown files into a fully functional static site. With MkDocs, you get a straightforward setup, using a single YAML configuration file to manage your site.

??? tip "B-roll ideas"
    - Start with a screen recording showing a simple MkDocs site being generated from Markdown files.
    - Transition to a split-screen comparison: on one side, show the basic MkDocs site, and on the other, a site using Material for MkDocs with its enhanced design.

- On the other hand, **Material for MkDocs** is a theme built on top of MkDocs. It transforms your documentation site with a modern, responsive design inspired by Material Design principles. Now, what's important to note is that this theme doesn't just change the look; it enhances functionality with built-in plugins that support features like blog posts, social cards, advanced search capabilities and loads more.

- So basically, **MkDocs** provides the core functionality of building a static site, while **Material for MkDocs** signficantly elevates the visual and interactive experience of your documentation.

- Ok, now that's out of the way, let's get to work on setting up our new Material for MkDocs site.

## 2. Prereqs

!!! example "Section Metadata"

    **:material-video-box: Recording Type**: Narration

    **:material-text-box: Description**: Cover off the prerequisites that the user needs to have installed to follow along with the tutorial

    **:octicons-git-branch-16: Demo Branch**: `N/A`

- Before we begin, letâ€™s go over the prerequistes youâ€™ll need to have installed if you want to follow along with this tutorial

??? tip "B-roll ideas"
    Mac and Windows logos flash on screen

- Firstly, do be aware that iâ€™ll be conducting this tutorial on a Mac. If youâ€™re following on Windows then some of the commands we type into the terminal will be ever so slightly differentâ€¦ but Iâ€™ll try to call those out.

??? tip "B-roll ideas"
    List of these prereqs appear to left or right of me

- So weâ€™re going to be using the __PYTHON__ version of MkDocs in this tutorial, and youâ€™ll need to have PYTHON 3 installed. Iâ€™ll be using version `3.12.4` in this video, so either that or a later version should work fine.
- Weâ€™ll be using the Python package manager called PIP to install the required dependenciesâ€¦ but if you are running Python 3.4 or later then PIP is included anyway by defaultâ€¦ otherwise if youâ€™re using an earlier version, you might need to install PIP.
- Now, to follow along with the coding, itâ€™s helpful if you have an IDE installed, and Iâ€™ll be using Visual Studio Code in this video.
- And finally, weâ€™ll be publishing our documentation portal on GITHUB PAGESâ€¦ so youâ€™ll need to have an account on [GitHub](http://github.com) and ideally have git installed and setup to work from the command line as well.

And thatâ€™s all we should need. So letâ€™s jump over to a terminal and get started!

## 3. Initial Installation

!!! example "Section Metadata"

    **:material-video-box: Recording Type**: Screencast

    **:material-text-box: Description**: In this section we go over creating the Python virtual environment and creating a vanilla MkDocs site

    **:octicons-git-branch-16: Demo Branch**: `1_InitialInstallation`

- Open a terminal in the folder that you want to create the project in
- Do `which python` to show my Python is aliased to `python3`
- Do `which python3` to show my Python is installed with Homebrew
    - Mention if you are running on Windows you can do **`where python` instead**
- Virtual environment setup with `python -m venv venv`
- `source venv/bin/activate` to activate virtual environment
- Check pip version `pip --version`
- Install mkdocs material - `pip install mkdocs-material`
- Open Visual studio code in this folder with `vscode .`
- Open a terminal within VS code and create the new site `mkdocs new .`
- Add basic `mkdocs.yml` configuration:

```yaml title="mkdocs.yml"
site_name: My MkDocs Material Documentation
site_url: https://sitename.example
theme:
  name: material
```

- Do `mkdocs serve` to launch the site
- Check the site at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

---

## 4. Add Yaml Schema Validation

!!! example "Section Metadata"

    **:material-video-box: Recording Type**: Screencast

    **:material-text-box: Description**: Add MkDocs Material Yaml Schema Validation

    **:octicons-git-branch-16: Demo Branch**: `N/A`

- Explain that to activate most of the useful features in MkDocs Material, we need to make a few changes to the `mkdocs.yml` fileâ€¦ making these changes is much easier with the help of YAML schema validation.
- Install the `Yaml` plugin within Extensions
    - Plugin can also be found on [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)
- In VsCode open `settings.json`. You can open this by clicking on settings in the bottom left gear icon, then clicking the document icon in the top right.
- Add the following at the bottom:

```json title="settings.json"
  "yaml.schemas": {
    "https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/schema.json": "mkdocs.yml"
  },
  "yaml.customTags": [
    "!ENV scalar",
    "!ENV sequence",
    "!relative scalar",
    "tag:yaml.org,2002:python/name:material.extensions.emoji.to_svg",
    "tag:yaml.org,2002:python/name:material.extensions.emoji.twemoji",
    "tag:yaml.org,2002:python/name:pymdownx.superfences.fence_code_format"
  ]
```

- Show the `mkdocs.yml` file and how we now get popups when we mouse over elements

---

## 5. Adjust Color Scheme

!!! example "Section Metadata"

    **:material-video-box: Recording Type**: Screencast

    **:material-text-box: Description**: Setup Light and Dark mode toggle within MkDocs, and change the colour scheme

    **:octicons-git-branch-16: Demo Branch**: `2_AdjustColor`


- Let's start making some changes to the style of our documentation, starting with the color scheme.
- I'll start by changing the color scheme to black. Add this to the `mkdocs.yml` file:

```yaml title="mkdocs.yml"
theme:
  name: material
  palette: 
    scheme: slate
```

- Change the primary colour to green by adding `primary: green` under the palette:

```yaml title="mkdocs.yml" hl_lines="5"
theme:
  name: material
  palette: 
    scheme: slate
    primary: green
```

- We can see that this makes the banner green, and also the hyperlinks green.
- Let's also change the accent colour to `deep purple`:

```yaml title="mkdocs.yml" hl_lines="6"
theme:
  name: material
  palette: 
    scheme: slate
    primary: green
    accent: deep purple
```

- Now when we hover over the links with the mouse, they turn purple.

- Another cool thing we can easily do in MkDocs is add a toggle to our site that allows the user to switch between light and dark modes. Add this to `palette` in the `mkdocs.yml` file to enable this:

```yaml title="mkdocs.yml"
theme:
  name: material
  palette:
    #Â Dark Mode
    - scheme: slate
      toggle:
        icon: material/weather-sunny
        name: Dark mode
      primary: green
      accent: deep purple

    # Light Mode
    - scheme: default
      toggle:
        icon: material/weather-night
        name: Light mode
      primary: blue
      accent: deep orange
```

- There are lots of other configuration options available to you in Material for MkDocs if you want to adjust the colour, for example adding custom colours or automatically switching between light and dark mode based on the time of day

??? tip "B-roll ideas"

## 6. Adjust Font

!!! example "Section Metadata"

    **:material-video-box: Recording Type**: Screencast

    **:material-text-box: Description**: Change the font used on the MkDocs website

    **:octicons-git-branch-16: Demo Branch**: `3_AdjustFont`

- Let's see how we can change the font in our documentation.

??? tip "B-roll ideas"
    Scrolling screenshot of [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Montserrat)

- Material for MkDocs supports any [Google font](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Montserrat) directly out of the box.

- Let's change the default font to `Merriweather Sans` :

```yaml title="mkdocs.yml" hl_lines="3"
theme:
  font:
    text: Merriweather Sans
```

- We can also change the font of the `code` in our docs:

```yaml title="mkdocs.yml" hl_lines="4"
theme:
  font:
    text: Merriweather Sans
    code: Red Hat Mono
```

??? tip "B-roll ideas"
    Scrolling screenshot of [fonts documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-fonts/#customization)

- Now if you want to add additional fonts beyond Google fonts, or change other font configuration, do check the [Material font documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-fonts/)

## 8. Using Emojs

!!! example "Section Metadata"

    **:material-video-box: Recording Type**: Screencast

    **:material-text-box: Description**: Show how to configure Emojis and Icons and use them in the documentation

    **:octicons-git-branch-16: Demo Branch**: `4_Emojs`

- Another cool thing about Material for MkDocs is the possibility of using over 10,000 emojis and icons in your documentation, pretty much out of the box

??? tip "B-roll ideas"
    Screencast of searching for [Emojis](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/icons-emojis/#search)

- If you head over to the [Material Emoji Documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/icons-emojis/#search), you can easily search through everything that is available.
- To add the ability to use these to your documentation portal, add this config to your `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml title="mkdocs.yml"
markdown_extensions:
  - attr_list
  - pymdownx.emoji:
      emoji_index: !!python/name:material.extensions.emoji.twemoji
      emoji_generator: !!python/name:material.extensions.emoji.to_svg
```

- Then add a sentence to the `index.md` file with a couple of emojis

---

## 9. Logos and Icons

!!! example "Section Metadata"

    **:material-video-box: Recording Type**: Screencast

    **:material-text-box: Description**: Show how to change the logo and favicon of the site

    **:octicons-git-branch-16: Demo Branch**: `5_LogoAndIcons`

- Now that we have emojis and icons setup in our documentation, let's see how we can change the logo of our site.

### Icon for Logo
- Search for `solid-w` and find the fontawesome icon we want to use for the logo.
- Change the icon by making this change to the `mkdocs.yml`

```yaml title="mkdocs.yml"
theme:
  icon:
    logo: fontawesome/solid/w
```

### Image for Logo
- Mention how we could also change the logo to an image if we prefer.
- Inside the `docs` folder create an `assets` folder.
- Add the `logo.png`, which is our site logo that I generated earlier.
- Now change `mkdocs.yml` to:

```yaml title="mkdocs.yml"
theme:
  logo: assets/logo.png
```

### Change Favicon
- Let's change the favicon as well.
- First i'll add the `favicon.ico` file to the `assets` folder we just created.
- Then adjust `mkdocs.yml` to:

```yaml title="mkdocs.yml"
theme:
  favicon: assets/favicon.ico
```

??? tip "B-roll ideas"
    Screencast of [icon and logos documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-logo-and-icons/)

- You can change other icons on your MkDocs Material site in a similar way, but if you want to know more check the [Material Logo and Icons Documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-logo-and-icons/)

---

## 10. Code Blocks

!!! example "Section Metadata"

- One of the best features of Material for MkDocs is it's ability to display code in a clear, crisp and distinctive manner.
- Let's create a new page in our documentation called `code-examples.md`
- And add in the following example Python code:

```py title="code-examples.md"
# Function to add two numbers
def add_two_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2

# Example usage
result = add_two_numbers(5, 3)
print('The sum is:', result)
```

- Show the viewer the code in the browser - it looks OK but not colouring, let's change that next
- We need to add some extra configuration to our `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml title="mkdocs.yml"
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.highlight:
      anchor_linenums: true
      line_spans: __span
      pygments_lang_class: true
  - pymdownx.inlinehilite
  - pymdownx.snippets
  - pymdownx.superfences
```

- Now go back and show the code is nicely highlighted
- Mention that if you want to use another language find the lexers (short names for the language) on this [pygments](https://pygments.org/docs/lexers/#lexers-for-javascript-and-related-languages) page
    - e.g. [typescript](https://pygments.org/docs/lexers/#pygments.lexers.javascript.TypeScriptLexer)

### Add Title

- Add a title to the codeblock by doing `py title="add_numbers.py"`

### Add Line Numbers

- Add line numbers by doing `py linenums="1"`
- Also show the line numbers can start from a different number

### Highlight Lines

- To highlight lines do `py hl_lines="2-4"`
- Use another codeblock to show this:

```js title="code-examples.md" linenums="1" hl_lines="2-4"
// Function to concatenate two strings
function concatenateStrings(str1, str2) {
  return str1 + str2;
}

// Example usage
const result = concatenateStrings("Hello, ", "World!");
console.log("The concatenated string is:", result);
```

- Talk briefly about when content tabs would be useful, e.g. for different code examples
- To enable them, add this configuration to `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml title="mkdocs.yml"
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.superfences
  - pymdownx.tabbed:
      alternate_style: true
```

- Create a new page called `content-tabs.md`
- Add the following to show `generic` content tabs:

```
## Content Tabs

This is some examples of content tabs.

### Generic Content

=== "Plain text"

    This is some plain text

=== "Unordered list"

    * First item
    * Second item
    * Third item

    1. First item
    2. Second item
    3. Third item
```

- Then show how we can use content tabs with code blocks, with this:

```
### Code Blocks in Content Tabs

=== "Python"

    ```py
    def main():
        print("Hello world!")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

=== "JavaScript"

    ```js
    function main() {
        console.log("Hello world!");
    }

    main();
    ```
```

    **:material-text-box: Description**: Summary of the video and where to go next

    **:octicons-git-branch-16: Demo Branch**: `N/A`

- In this video we've seen how to create and deploy an entire Material for MkDocs documentation website completely from scratch, and taken a look at just a few of the awesome features that Material for MkDocs ships with.

??? tip "B-roll ideas"
    Screencast of [MkDocs Material documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/)

- We've only really scratched the surface of what Material offers in this video... so to learn more about the many other features that are on offer, do check out the [official documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/)

- But what about you? Are you using Material for MkDocs? What other features would you like to see covered? Let me know in the comments down below, I'd love to hear from you.
- But that's all for this video, I'll see you in the next one.
