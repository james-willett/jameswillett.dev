# Starting The Business Method

I'm working through an online course called [The Business Method](https://productivitymethod.com/pages/the-business-method) from Grace Beverly. The course makes heavy use of some Notion templates, but I've found that the information captured in them is difficult to share effectively. I've therefore decided that I'll use my blog to capture and share the information.

<!-- more -->

At present, I'm only planning to record all the information from Module 1 in this blog. Module 1 focuses on identifying your business idea and opportunity, and is where a lot of the brainstorming work happens. I'll consider adding my notes from the later modules to this blog at a later date, if that makes sense.

To see all the blog posts related to the course, just click on [The Business Method](../../category/the-business-method.md) category.
