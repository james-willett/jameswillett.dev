<!-- more -->

Here are some buyer personas related to my business:

TODO

- Go through the CHAPTER 6 workbook in business method, but do it for Komoda not MkDocs
- Fill the answers in here, similar to have it was done for Chapter 3

## Persona 1: Aftab

!!! info "How old are they"

    30

!!! info "Where do they work or live?"

    Software engineer in London

!!! abstract "What do they do in their spare time, where do they go?"

    Look after family, volunteer in the community, build websites for fun and to explore new technologies

!!! success "What is their motivation to purchase a product, and what other brands do they purchase from?"

    They need to know how to deploy and customise Material for MkDocs. They purchase courses from other platforms like Udemy, but need this Material for MkDocs knowledge.

!!! tip "What brands would they LIKE to purchase from if they could afford it?"

    Bespoke software engineering mentorship programs that can guide and help them in their careers

!!! question "What features are they looking for when purchasing, where do they purchase and what are the main things they’re thinking about when purchasing?"

    High quality content that contains all the information required with minimal fluff. They will purchase online. They are thinking “Will this help me get Material for MkDocs running in the way I want with minimal effort”

!!! bug "What pain points do they face that you and your product are going to solve?"

    Overwhelm of learning a documentation portal, how to deploy it and customise it in the way that they want, wish there was someone to hold my hand and guide me through
