## General Notes

- Adopt a problem first approach.
- What problem or challenges do people (or YOU) face in their daily lives?
- Who is your target audience?
- People will spend more in a niche that is relevant to them.

## Worksheet

The information below is taken from the worksheet **Identifying Problem First Business Ideas** for this module


### Problems To Solve

#### Software Engineer Content Creation Problems:

- Software engineers want to make courses or similar products to sell their knowledge.
- They typically have no idea where to start, and feel overwhelmed even thinking about it.
- There are way too many tools and processes and too much information scattered everywhere.
- They aren't confident talking on camera or in presentations.
- They don't have strong visual design skills (e.g. for presentations)
- They want guidance and hand holding from someone who has already done it.
- Even if they could create a course, they would not know how to marketing and sell it.


### Idea Validation Exercise

| What is your product idea? | Guidance for Software Developers on Creating Courses or Monetizing their Knowledge |
| --- | --- |
| What problem are you trying to solve with this product? | Help them create a course or give them the framework to do it |
| What is the gap in the market or underserved niche that you’re tapping into?  | More and more demand for courses… hard to produce something “good” |
| Are you personally affected by this consumer problem in your own life? | Yes |
| Does the business idea align with your skills and/or interests? | Yes |
| Who would be your hypothetical target customer? | Software engineers with some experience. Maybe laid off. Maybe want to quit job and work for themselves. |
| Do you fit within your target customer profile? If not, how much do you know about the target demographic?  | Yes |
| How would this idea make your hypothetical customers day better?  | They make money and gain freedom |
| Why would your target customer want your product over what’s already available on the market? | Because there isn’t anything like this on the market, and because its ME. |
| What are the current trends, concepts and technologies related to this product idea? | Learning new technologies is becoming a thing… layoffs in tech… teaching others is important and satsifying |
| Is this business idea something that could potentially be replaced by technology/AI in the future? | I guess maybe… but you could say that about most businesses at the moment…. i still think a bespoke serivce from a real human has a lot of value for now |

### Existing Competitor Products

| **Brand/Product** | **Existing Pain Point/Problem With This Product** | **What Solution/Point of Difference Would You Offer to Overcome This With Your Product?** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [badass.dev](https://badass.dev/) | doesn't actually offer anything (at least not yet) |  |
| plenty of other resources on “how to create a course” | They aren’t for software eningeers | mine is |
| [simple programmer](https://simpleprogrammer.com/) | More broader software engineering advice for monetisation | Be more focussed on course and content creation |
